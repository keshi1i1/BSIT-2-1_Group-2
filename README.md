This is the leader of DSA Group 2. I have split the system into 6 parts. Each member have their own part that I distributed. Unlike other groups that decided to allocate one person for design, one for database, etc.
In our group, I decided that we do our own part using our own knowledge for our own design and functions. This is to see how much a member have done in their assigned program.

These are the memebrs and their assigned program:
- Resma (AccountLogin)
- Romulo (MenuSelection)
- Gualberto (OrderSelection, ConfirmOrder)
- Bautista,R (DeliveryStatus)
- Anchoriz (OrderHistory)
- Alicaway (CustomerProfile, EmailVerification, ChangePassword)

P.S. This is an incomplete system that only focuses on design and some functions (GUI). We have not implemented the data structures needed yet. In the future, expect a change in our system as we learn the data
structures needed like Hash Table and other stuffs.
