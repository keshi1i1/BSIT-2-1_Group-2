This is the leader of DSA Group 2. 
I have split the system into 6 parts. 
Each member have their own part that I distributed. 
Unlike other groups that decided to allocate one person for design, one for database, etc. 
In our group, I decided that we do our own part using our own knowledge for our own design and functions. 
This is to see how much a member have done in their assigned program.

These are the members and their assigned program:
- Resma (AccountLogin)
- Romulo (MenuSelection)
- Gualberto (OrderSelection, ConfirmOrder)
- Bautista,R (DeliveryStatus)
- Anchoriz (OrderHistory)
- Alicaway (CustomerProfile, EmailVerification, ChangePassword)

P.S. This is an incomplete system that only focuses on design and some functions (GUI). 
We have not implemented a database and the data structures needed yet. 
In the future, expect a change in our system as we learn the data structures needed like Hash Table and other stuffs. 
In addition, please do not expect many commits from us. 
I told everyone that only after they are done with their GUI is when we will be pushing in our own branch.
